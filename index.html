      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <div class="about-container">
        <p>
          I was born in an Apartheid World and kicked into a free world, no one quite prepared me for. I was however afforded the opportunity and exposure to missions, which taught me, to discover the gift of people and places. In this last season I have decided to focus on my own self, family and world. My own community contained alot of conundrums, and when asking about it, mostly the answer was "You won't understand". In order to then understand, it caused me to go on a journey, a journey of Genealogy Courses, reading books, phoning professors and historians, and winning over those "You won't understands" to see there is a purpose in sharing their stories. There is also the joy of uncovering the history of people group, long forgotten and discovering the connectivity of most South Africans and my roots in the World and using technology to visually display or solve some of my problems.

      <h2 id="tech">Tech + History</h2>
      <p>
        As you can tell from this website, History is my main love, but in this current age, many don't know their history and thus history repeats itself. Web development opens up so many possibilities to address this, from visually allowing people to share their stories online, to calculating data and telling new stories with Data Visualization. On a tech end, I have began to code a few ideas that is history related:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> Family Map: You may be familiar with a family tree. This instead represents all the family members per generation by dots on a coordinate on a map and thus one can see the movement of the family over time. This idea also can be used then to map other movements.</li>
        <li> Family Register Help: This will not only help curate and co ordinate a family history project, but also the printing of the book after. Again History, genealogy and information for non white individuals in South Africa is still a new endeavour and this will help it greatly.</li>
        <li> Forced Removals App: Today few realise the impact of Apartheid on communities as once again everything is not written and accessible. To aid in this I have thought of creating an App that allows people to enter their address before they were forcibly removed and then the results of this would show on a map by year, dots jumping across the city by the year.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The rest of this webpage is a continuation of recording ideas, my research and further information. Whilst this is strictly not about my love for tech, It is through tech that I am able to express and share this valuable knowledge. Not enough work has been done merging history and tech, allowing people access to information and this is one of my goals. So enjoy!

            <h5 class="card-title">MAASDORP</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Family Groups Represented by German Lineage - by Christian Matzdorf/Maasdorp arriving in 1695, from,the north in Pasewalk, possibly convinced to work for the VOC by zielverkopers who lure poor farm boys to work for the VOC giving them lodging till they get a job, and ending up having to spend the first 5 years of working to pay back. Starting as a sailor, which was one above Slave in the VOC, to a Wagon Maker, to a Pub called Varietas Delectat, to being part of the Dragoons and owning farms. Christian is my grandmother's grandmother's grandfather's grandfather's father, our progenitor and inspires me to take the opportunities that come my way.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">VAN BENGAL</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Indian/Bengal Lineage: Ansela van Bengal, to become one of the richest women at the Cape, herself a child slave stolen from Bengal and taken to Indonesia. Later in life she is sold to Jan Van Riebeeck and is part of his ship and slaves brought to the Cape. She is freed by Abraham Gabemma? and becomes very wealthy managing her estate well after her husband Arnoldus Basson's death. Her daughter Maria Basson marries Christian. What inspires me is that in 2014 going to India and being in the Ganges River, at that stage I did not know I am a 10th generation of her. Since going to India, people have told me in India and the USA I look Indian, and also I have met several Bengali people. I would like to believe in going to India, somehow Ansela was able/touch home again by one of her descendants going home.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">BOONZAAIER</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The town of Franschhoek is filled with mixed-race people with the surname Boonzaaier. Having looked at the baptismal registers and archives, and there being only one white Boonzaaier in the time period most were born, him being a foreman with a mixed wife, my theory is that when slavery ended they adopted his surname. There is just too many Boonzaaiers to all be one person's children. Also interesting to note is many people still stay in the same places and farms so it is not too hard to link original slaves with present day families. My intention is to restore identity in region and make people aware that there were more than just the French in Franschhoek.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">CLARKE</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Genealogy began sometime in the nineties with a school project, my grandmother telling me her grandfather Jesse Clarke was one of 2 brothers who came from England. The one married a white woman the other a "Baster Vrou", Christina. Continuing this journey helped me uncover alot of Baster history but also realise, I have alot in common with the British Settlers, as apartheid made us believe each story was only for one group. It was in fact not only 2 brothers who came but the whole family and my dear Jesse's father died in those frontier wars.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">DE WET</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Whenever asking whether we related to Pniel De Wets, the answer was always No. But after I took a drive too Pniel to find out answers, the next week I discovered the probate of my father's greatgrandfather and found he was born in Pniel. More mysteries: The owner of his wife's mother during slavery was a De Wet on Solms Delta where his father was born, first as Benjamin Salamons and later changing the surname to De Wet. My grandfather once got a fishing rod for free from the old De Wet Sports Shop when discovered they are related. Also there is a white De Wet farm in Robertson called Zandvliet, Solms Delta was first called Zandvliet, and where our De Wets end up today is Sandvlei, Zandvliet??? If we connect to the De Wet tree then my father is also connected to Ansela van Bengal as my mother is, as her daughter Anna de Koning marries Olof Bergh and their daughter marries the first de Wet.</p>

      <h2 id="lessons">Lessons Learnt</h2>
      <p>
        The following are some lessons and reflections in this family history journey:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You understand your parents choices when you know their stories</li>
        <li>Without Identity there is no Inheritance</li>
        <li>Each Generation hands over a gift, a baton, our parents generation was the Gift of Opportunity.</li>
        <li>I was raised in an apartheid world of rules, order, fear, authoritarianism and kicked in a free world that I was not prepared for</li>
        <li>We keep falling for the same things because we don't know our history</li>
        <li>What is the freedom or the equality people fought for until 1994. If you do not empower people, they are still not free</li>
        <li>Since Adam Tas and others booted out Willem Adrian VD Stel, the Cape has not been free for people of colour. So from 1702 about till 1994, the Cape was not free for rule by people of colour, can you really say 26 years was enough</li>
